### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have zero idea what to put here, so I'm going to sarcastically describe myself.

- Currently working on: Training AI models and learning to use Python.
- Tried learning TypeScript, failed, now dead inside.
- Writes instant legacy code in Node.js, Java and C.
- Fluent in DreamBerd and JDSL.
- Wrote Svelte once. (Maybe twice)
- Went trekking once, nearly died.
- Can scuba dive.

FUN FACT: Pythons and boa constrictors have tiny legs.
